  <script type="text/javascript">

    // EXAMPLE ONE:
    // --------------------------------------------------
    // What is "this" going to print?

    // Answer: "WINDOW"
    // Explanation: In this case "this" references the window (since it isn't inside of any object).
    console.log(this);


    // EXAMPLE TWO:
    // --------------------------------------------------
    // What is "this" going to print?

    // Answer: "WINDOW"
    // Explanation: Again, in this case 'this' references the window, since it isn't tied to any specific object.
    function myFunction() {
      console.log(this);
    }
    myFunction();

    // EXAMPLE THREE (IMPORTANT):
    // --------------------------------------------------
    // What is "someObj.say()" going to print?

    // Answer: "Red Hat"
    // Explanation: "someObj.say()" will print "this.name", which in this case references the "someObj" object.
    var someObj = {
      name: "Red Hat",
      say: function() {
        console.log(this.name);
      }
    };
    someObj.say();


    // EXAMPLE FOUR (BONUS, TRICKY!):
    // --------------------------------------------------
    // What is "myObj.yell()" going to print? Why?

    // Answer: "Object > name: 'Star Powerup'"
    // Explanation: Very tricky one!
    // In this case, one would think the output should be: "Object > name: 'Blue Shell".
    // However, in this case, the keyword: "this" changes meaning mid-way through the function call.
    // At first "this" refers to "myObj", but as we go inside the "changeName" function "this" means "Window".
    // The takeaway here is that one needs to be ultra careful of one's use of the keyword: "this".


//Declare object.
var myObj = {
      //Assigning a name property, with a ""  value. 
      name: "",
      //Assign a yell property. that is a function.
      yell: function() {
        //Change the name from "" to "Star Powerup" for myObj.
        this.name = "Star Powerup";
          //Declaring a function called changeName, that takes a parameter called newName. 
          //newName is used to assign a new name to the window.
          //We are assigning the name to the window, because this function is declared within another function whcih is in an object. 
          //Logic may indicate that this should be a part of the object but this is a javascript "gotcha" in which the function is actually declared as part of the
          //Global scope. The global scope means that when we say 'this' we are referring to the window since that is as far back as we can go. 
          var changeName = function(newName) {
              //This is where we assign the window, the new name that was passed in. Essentially, this reads window.name = newName. 
              this.name = newName;
              console.log("`this` refers to the window here, because this nested function loses the myObj scope. console.log(this):")
              console.log(this);
              console.log("so we're setting the name '" + newName + "' on the window. console.log(window.name):");
              console.log(window.name);
              console.log("`window` contains the global scope, so you can log the variable itself. console.log(name):")
              console.log(name);
        };

        changeName("Blue Shell");
        changeName("Raven");
        console.log("Window name is : "+window.name);
        console.log("myObj name is: "+myObj.name);
      }
    };
    //This is where we call yell within myObj and make the changes as listed above. 
    myObj.yell();

    // EXAMPLE FIVE (BONUS, TRICKY!):
    // --------------------------------------------------
    // What is "myObj.yell()" going to print? Why?

    // Answer: "Object > name: 'Blue Shell'"
    // Explanation: This example "solves" the issue from the previous bonus.
    // In order to maintain scope throughout the function we created a variable called: "thisObject".
    // This "thisObject" variable latches onto the original "myObj" instance of "this" to preserve state.
    // Now, we can use the object "thisObject" in our "changeName" function to set the new name.
    // Tricky indeed! Don't worry if you don't quite get it. This is more of a theoretical challenge.

    //Declared myObj object, just like before. 
    var myObj = {
      //Name is still blank ""
      name: "",
      //Declare yell function, jjust like before. 
      yell: function() {

        // Here we make use of the "thisObject" variable to hold the state of "this"
        //Here were saying that thisObject is equal to 'this' which refers to myObj. 
        //In essence what we are saying is that thisObject = myObj. 
        var thisObject = this;
        //Changes name of myObj to Star Powerup just like before. 
        this.name = "Star Powerup";
        //Declare the function within the yell function, meaning that we lose scope, and this is now
        //bound to the global scope aka the window. 
        var changeName = function(newName) {
          //thisObject, as we made note on line 114, is essentially saying myObj, so the statement on
          //line 122, is saying myObj.name = newName. 
          thisObject.name = newName;
        };
        //Calls our function and changes name to Blue Shell
        changeName("Blue Shell");
        //This should log the object with the name Blue Shell and yell function. 
        console.log(thisObject);
        console.log(this.name);
      }
    };
    //Calls the yell function so we can see our work above. 
    myObj.yell();
